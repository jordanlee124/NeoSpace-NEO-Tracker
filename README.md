# Near Earth Object(NEO) Tracker
## Project description
Due to the world's growing interest in regards to space, there is an overwhelming amount of data being collected to cater to this incline in curiosity. As a group, we came together and decided to create a webpage which tracks the NEOs with a visually enticing interface and some engaging feature. With this, we created a website that is friendly for all users with varying levels of understanding and knowledge about space. 

For the development stack, we used:
* JavaScript to add dynamics to our website for better engagement. Also, JS was used to communicate with NASA's NEO API and our database.
* Firebase as the database to store images and track likes each image are given. (The Database is currently down so, the communities images page is not operational)
* HTML to build the front-end structure.
* CSS to provide character and to visually enhance the website's front-end.

Some problems we faced were the fact that the API had a limited number of queries we could make per hour, but as students, we couldn't affor their purchase plan which slowed down development slightly. An another problem we faced was the fact that not many of us had experience with web development, especially in the front-end. So, a lot of time was spent on Google for self-learning. 

This project was a great learning experience for all of us. Whether it be learning a new language, working on a project as a team or becoming more comfortable with front-end and back-end programming.

## How to run the project
The website is currently not uploaded to the internet, so to explore our website, you will have to download this repository as a zip file. 

Then unzip the file and navigate to the HTML file with all the pages are (SourceCode_and_Documentation/HTML/)

To simulate first landing on the page, click on the *index* page and enjoy the site! 

## Extra Note
We were tasked to write up a report for this project. If you would like to check this out, go to the *Deliverables* directory.
